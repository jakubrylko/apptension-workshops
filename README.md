# Apptension Workshops

In this project, I developed automated tests using JavaScript and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) during an internal workshop series at [Apptension](https://www.apptension.com/). The tests were conducted on our own products, such as [Teamdeck](https://teamdeck.io/) and [SaaS Boilerplate](https://www.apptension.com/saas-boilerplate). In addition to regular UI tests, I also implemented Rest API and GraphQL tests. Furthermore, more advanced tests were created, involving data mocking and environmental variable handling, and I also set up a basic configuration for ESLint and Prettier.
