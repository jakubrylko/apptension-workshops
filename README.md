# Apptension Workshops

In this project, I developed automated tests using JavaScript and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) during an internal workshop series at [Apptension](https://www.apptension.com/). Tests were conducted on our own products, such as [Teamdeck](https://teamdeck.io/) and [SaaS Boilerplate](https://www.apptension.com/saas-boilerplate). In addition to regular UI tests, I was working on Rest API and GraphQL tests. On top of that, I created some more advanced tests involving data mocking and environmental variable handling. Finally, I created a basic setup for ESLint and Prettier.
